# Instagram-Botnet
An instagram botnet using instagram api/instabot.py
first download https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py and setup the bot
then put the botnet.py file from this repository into the 
instabot-py directory that you downloaded from https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py

I am using python 2.7 but I am not sure if python 3 works with this script
