 and # Instagram-Botnet
An instagram botnet using instagram api/instabot.py
Basically this script logs into multiple instagram accounts and follows one user, this is the same way that people sell instagram followers, keep in mind you will have to add your instagram accounts to this script yourself
first download https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py and setup the bot
then put the botnet.py file from this repository into the 
instabot-py directory that you downloaded from https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py and run botnet.py after editing it and adding your accounts

I am using python 2.7 but I am not sure if python 3 works with this script
